#uWave Theremin
One of three devices made for EECS Senior Design at UCF, Fall 2012. See http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/seniordesign/su2012fa2012/g01.

##Jumpers
You'll notice there are some built-in test points, attach a scope to these for debugging. Also, you'll notice three sets of jumpers that divide the board apart. 
Jumpers go from
> FPO_OUT to FPO
> VPO_OUT to VPO
> PROC_IN to PIN12_GND

##Inductors
The inductor windings must all have the same direction, pick a start point and be consistent.
